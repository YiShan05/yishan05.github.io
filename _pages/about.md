Hi, I'm Yi Shan, a junior undergraduate student from the Experimental Class of Computer Science and Technology, [Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)](https://www.bjut.edu.cn). I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD in the field of LLM. My research interest focus on post-training of LLMs and multi-view learning.  
During my multi-view research period, I am grateful to [Prof. Gengyu Lyu](https://gengyulyu.github.io/homepage/) for his guidance, which has cultivated my scientific research thinking.
